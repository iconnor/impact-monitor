# Estimated Force and Pressure

In this project, we're aiming to calculate the force and pressure exerted by a karate strike (a punch, chop, or kick). The calculations are based on two fundamental physical principles: Newton's second law of motion and the definition of pressure.

1. **Newton's Second Law of Motion**

    Newton's second law states that the force exerted by an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration:
    $$
     F = m \times a
    $$
    where:

    - F is the force (in Newtons, N),
    - m is the mass (in kilograms, kg), and
    - a is the acceleration (in meters per second squared, m/s²).

    For instance, if the mass of the hand is 0.5 kg and the acceleration is 10 m/s² ([approximately the acceleration due to gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity)), the force exerted would be:

    $$ F = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \times 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 5 \, \text{N} $$

2. **Pressure**

    Pressure is defined as the force applied per unit area:

    $$ P = \frac{F}{A} $$

    where:

    - P is the pressure (in Pascals, Pa), 
    - F is the force (in Newtons, N), and
    - A is the area (in square meters, m²).

    If we continue with the previous example and consider a hand's striking surface area of 0.01 m², the pressure would be:

    $$ P = \frac{5 \, \text{N}}{0.01 \, \text{m}^2} = 500 \, \text{Pa} $$

3. **Conversion to PSI**

    To convert this pressure from Pascals (Pa) to pounds per square inch (PSI), we use the conversion factor 1 Pa = 0.000145038 PSI. Therefore:

    $$ P_{\text{PSI}} = P_{\text{Pa}} \times 0.000145038 $$

    Applying this conversion to our example:

    $$ P_{\text{PSI}} = 500 \, \text{Pa} \times 0.000145038 \approx 0.0725 \, \text{PSI} $$

Please note that the actual mass of the striking body part and its surface area can significantly vary between different individuals and techniques. The force and pressure calculations are instantaneous and assume that the pressure is uniformly distributed across the entire surface area and that all of the force of the strike is transferred to the target. This may not be the case in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, if the strike is fast and contact with the target is brief, the average force and pressure over time might be lower than the instantaneous peak values.
